# ðŸ”° BFFS - Backend for Frontend Shield

BFFS is a simple project built with Laravel that implements the backend for frontend pattern to help you build a security shield in front of your APIs and Microservices.

Here are some key points about BFFS:

- Includes advanced request validation features, such as E.164 international phone number standard, password NIST standards, email RFC and DNS validation, email spoofing detection, and scanning uploaded files with Cisco ClamAV.
- Uses Redis for rate limiting requests to improve security and reduce the risk of DDoS attacks.
- Utilizes Swoole to speed up response time and improve overall performance.
- Built using Laravel, a popular PHP web application framework, making it easy to integrate with existing systems.
